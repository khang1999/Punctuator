Okay Dr Cooke back and we're gonna be looking at part two of our AGADAP walkthrough of how we do our concept sketch 
Alright as a reminder here's the little map of our scenario and our platoon mission statement that first platoon attacks to breach an enemy minefield vicinity phase line granite in order to allow freedom maneuver for 166 armor to move through the gap and then attack a logistics hub to the east 
Uh Now last video we went through the first five steps AGADAP 
So you just kind of shown here of our uh relative combat power that we've chosen to do a penetration umh how we've laid out our forces arrayed them and uh set our phases and selected our leadership 
Okay so now we get our battle book page we're gonna do our COA statement and sketch and we can drive on with our sketch 
Alright so here's the page out of the battle book and uh we need to do both our sketch and our statement 
Now for this I'm gonna go ahead and and just start with uh the sketch 
Now uh we know that we're gonna start out in our assembly area 
Alright so we can go ahead and draw that up here at the top of the page and I wanna alot leave uh quite a bit of room down here to show what's gonna happen for actions on the objective 
Remember the COA sketch isn't to scale 
uh We're gonna need uh some kind of minor departure 
We know that's gonna happen 
Alright and we're gonna leave from the uh assembly area and we're gonna move to an ORP right 
So we gotta put our ORP on here uh and since that's gonna be a movement there's gonna be an axis to get us there 
Alright and uh thinking through this there's probably some phase line here 
Alright because we're gonna spend phase one in the assembly area phase two moving to the ORP and then phase three is all gonna happen in the ORP so there's probably a phase line here because we're gonna act differently at that point 
uh Now uh from this just thinking about my mission uh i'm gonna come down here and kind of do actions on the objective 
Now uh usually we don't we don't wanna show terrain on the COA sketch right 
So I'm not worried about is this route actually straight or what hills or streams might be here
But there is it's not a hard rule that you can't you should include key if there's any key kinds of terrain that are important to showing the COA sketch and making it make sense 
So if there was a bridge and it was an important thing uh that you're you're dealing with you might wanna show that 
uh But if it's just you're crossing a bridge as part of your movement you probably don't 
So uh in this case uh I do have uh I wanna show that we've got this minefield because that's important 
All right and I think for this mission uh you know if we come over here and look at our map right so we've got our mind field uh the fact that there's enemy on this bridge in the out here and enemy up on this spur over here 
I think that is important right 
That they're that they're up on those hilltops and this uh minefield is in a gap between these two hills 
So I am gonna go ahead and show uh you know it doesn't need to be perfect 
I just wanna give the impression that hey there there is these ridges here that are separating uh the gap for this minefield 
Okay except that that is important to what we're doing in this case
uh So we've got the our our operation here 
uh Now I'm gonna want to think about what are my tasks to subordinate units right 
So I know that I've got uh one of my units is going to be conducting a breach operation on the minefield 
So I've got a tactical task symbol for breach that has to go there 
uh and I can bring in my map and think about what we're doing 
So this enemy over on the north uh we said that we were gonna be trying to suppress them to keep them from interfering 
So I'm gonna go ahead and add that suppression symbol tactical task right there 
We said the anti tank team on the South bridge that we were gonna be trying to destroy them 
Remember that's solid lines on the destroying dashed lines on the suppress alright 
And then I know that uh there's this screen line out over here and we're gonna be sending a force to try and fix them so that they don't come up and interfere with us 
So I gotta get my fixing tactical tasks and I need to show kind of where that happens 
So here's all my breach operation 
uh And I understand as I come from the ORP uh you know the breach is in the middle and I've got the suppress and the destroy on on each side
uh But I gotta I gotta show the fix somewhere over here
uhh So I can just turn the page and give my fix symbol where that's gonna happen 
All right so I've got my tactical tasks on here 
Now I got to think about how do I get from the ORP out to these positions 
Right 
And how do I wanna do that now 
uhh I'm probably gonna have this fixing for us because it's it's just so far out there right 
And this is a small map 
So here's here's 100 meter scale 
You know this is only a couple hundred meters to this hill right 
Like this isn't our assembly area is way off this map 
This is zoomed in on the objective 
uh So our fixing force is probably gonna have to move around somewhere separate from the three elements that are gonna attack the the breach itself 
I'm probably going to send them I'm gonna plan to send them out of the ORP 
So I wanna show that uh they're gonna have to leave the ORP and swing more wide on this side to get to their location alright 
So go ahead and show that 
So now uh we understand one team is gonna move or what's a squad but one element is gonna move all the way around to do this fixing operation 
uh Now that I think about what I wanna do with these 
Now my task I don't have a support by fire task or or we're not seizing terrain where I've got a support element and then a uh moving assault element 
We've just got three tasks to go on with this
